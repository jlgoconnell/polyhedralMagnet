# polyhedralMagnet
Code to calculate interactions between polyhedral permanent magnets

Most of these functions are subfunctions and do not need to be used.

Two methods for calculating the force and torque between two polyhedral magnets are used.
The first is less efficient and can be done using the function polyhedronForceOld. The most recent is much more efficient and can be done using the function polyhedronForce.

The older method is usually used to quantify the performance of the newer method.
